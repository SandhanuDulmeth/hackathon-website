## Key Technologies

- **React 18**: UI library
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vanta.js**: Interactive Three.js animated backgrounds (Birds effect)
- **PostCSS & Autoprefixer**: CSS processing and vendor prefixes
- **gh-pages**: GitHub Pages deployment tool

## Features Breakdown

### Vanta Birds Background
- Full-viewport animated birds effect using Three.js + Vanta.js
- Initialized in App.jsx with retry-based loader (handles deferred CDN scripts)
- Colors tuned to match brand palette (cyan → fuchsia)
- Interactive mouse/touch controls enabled
- Automatically cleaned up on unmount to prevent memory leaks

### Hero Section
- **Cyberpunk Design**: Continuously scrolling headline with RGB color split effect and glitch animation
- **Animated Brain Icon**: Cyan-colored SVG with opacity effect
- **Event Details**: Calendar and clock icons with date/time information
- **CTA Button**: Smooth-scroll to Registration section
- **Scroll Indicator**: Animated down arrow suggesting more content below
- **Transparent Section**: Allows Vanta Birds background to remain visible throughout

### About Section
- Responsive two-column layout (stacked on mobile)
- Section header with scroll-triggered entrance animation
- Event description and key highlights in left column
- Four feature cards in grid layout:
  - **Innovation First**: Cutting-edge AI and intelligent solutions
  - **Collaborate & Connect**: Network with talented developers
  - **Win Big**: Compete for prizes and recognition
  - **Learn & Grow**: Hands-on experience with latest tech
- Event details card (48 hours, 500+ participants, $10K+ prizes)
- IntersectionObserver-based staggered entrance animations

### Registration Section
- **Form Fields**:
  - Name (required)
  - Email (required, with email validation)
  - Institution (required)
  - Team Size (dropdown: 1–5+ members)
  - Areas of Interest (checkboxes, at least one required)
- **Validation**: Real-time error clearing, comprehensive form validation with user-friendly messages
- **Success State**: Confirmation message after submission
- **Auto-reset**: Form clears after successful submission
- **Scroll Animations**: Staggered entrance animations for form elements

## Customization

### Background Animation (Vanta Birds)
Edit `src/App.jsx` to customize the Vanta effect:
```javascript
window.vantaEffect = VANTA.BIRDS({
  el: bgElement,
  color1: 0x00ffff,    // Cyan
  color2: 0xff00ff,    // Fuchsia
  quantity: 3.0,       // Bird density (1.0–5.0)
  birdSize: 1.2,       // Size scale
  wingSpan: 25.0,      // Wing animation span
  separation: 40.0,    // Distance between birds
  cohesion: 20.0,      // Grouping behavior
})
```

### Hero Scrolling Text & Glitch Effects
Edit `src/components/Hero.jsx` to adjust:
- RGB split animation speed and intensity
- Glitch offset values for visual effect
- Text scroll speed and animation timing

### Colors & Theme
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize colors and gradients:
```javascript
colors: {
  primary: "#1e40af",      // Blue
  secondary: "#dc2626",    // Red
  accent: "#f59e0b",       // Amber
}
```

### Animations
Modify keyframes in `tailwind.config.js` for entrance animations and transitions.

### Content
Update text, dates, and event details directly in component files.

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile)

**Note:** Vanta.js requires WebGL support and reasonably modern hardware for smooth animation.

## Performance

- **Optimized Build**: Vite provides sub-second HMR and production builds
- **Minimal Bundle**: Tree-shaking removes unused code
- **GPU Acceleration**: Vanta birds use WebGL for smooth 60fps animation
- **Lazy Loading**: Scroll animations only trigger when in viewport (IntersectionObserver)
- **CSS Transforms**: All animations use hardware-accelerated transforms
- **Deferred Scripts**: Vanta and Three.js load with `defer` to avoid blocking page render

## Notes

- All styling uses Tailwind utility classes (no external CSS files)
- Form submission is simulated client-side (no backend integration)
- Smooth scrolling enabled via CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`
- Fully responsive with mobile-first approach
- Vanta Birds background initializes on mount with retry logic for HMR reliability
- All images are inline SVGs (no external assets except CDN scripts)

## Troubleshooting

**Vanta background not showing?**
- Check browser console for Three.js/Vanta loading errors
- Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser
- Try refreshing the page (might be HMR timing issue)

**JSX syntax errors?**
- Ensure entry point is `src/index.jsx` (not `.js`)
- Vite requires proper file extensions for JSX files

**Slow animation on mobile?**
- Vanta bird quantity and size can be reduced in `src/App.jsx`
- Consider disabling touch controls for older devices
